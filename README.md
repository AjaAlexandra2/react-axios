# Project Summary

In this project, we are going to create a customer management tool for a computer repair shop. We'll keep track of basic customer information, such as name/email/phone, current repair statuses, and also a log for notes. This tool will use `axios` to hit an API and will also use `redux-promise-middleware` to asynchronously handle data from the API. Majority of the project has been built out already for you. The parts we'll need to finish include: the store, two reducers, two service files, and hooking up the service files into the components that use them.

## Setup

* `fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `npm i`.
* Run `npm start`.
  * The app in its current state should intentionally not compile correctly.
* In a new terminal:
  * `cd` into the project directory.
  * Run `npm run api`.
    * We will teach you about creating APIs later on in the course.

You should now have two processes running in two separate terminals. If you want to commit changes as you develop, use a third terminal.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step we will create our `store`. Since this tool will be hitting an API we'll need to `npm install redux-promise-middleware` to handle async actions. 

### Instructions

* `npm install --save redux-promise-middleware`.
* Open `src/store.js`.
* Import `createStore`, `applyMiddleware`, and `combineReducers` from `redux`.
  * We'll be using two reducers in this project. One for the customer list and one for customer editting.
  * Follow along in the detailed instructions if you are unfamiliar with `combineReducers`.
* Import `promiseMiddleware` from `redux-promise-middleware`.
* Import `listReducer` from `src/ducks/listReducer.js`.
* Import `workspaceReducer` from `src/ducks/workspaceReducer.js`.
* Export `createStore` by default:
  * Use `combineReducers` to hook up both reducers.
  * Use `undefined` for the initial state. ( Our reducers handle this )
  * Use `applyMiddleware` with `promiseMiddleWare` invoked.

If we take a look at our development server we'll see that our app is currently not compiling correctly. This is because some components are trying to connect to a store that doesn't exist. Let's create this store. Open `src/store.js`. We'll need three things from `redux`: `createStore`, `applyMiddleware`, and `combineReducers`. `createStore` will allows us to export the creation of our store. `applyMiddleware` will allow us to use middleware on actions that go to our reducers. `combineReducers` will allow us to use two different reducers to separate concerns of data.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from "redux";
```

We'll also need `redux-promise-middleware` to use in combination with `applyMiddleware`. We're using `redux-promise-middleware` to handle async API calls. Let's import this underneath our `redux` imports.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from "redux";
import promiseMiddleware from "redux-promise-middleware";
```

In order to create our store, we'll also need our reducers. So let's import those as well. Our reducers are located in `src/ducks`.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from "redux";
import promiseMiddleware from "redux-promise-middleware";

import listReducer from './ducks/listReducer';
import workspaceReducer from './ducks/workspaceReducer';
```

Now that we have all our imports, let's export by default the creation of our store. This will be done a little differently than how it was done in the mini project. We'll be using `combineReducers` to use two reducers. In order to use `combineReducers` you have to invoke it and pass in an object of reducers. For example: `combineReducers( { listReducer, workspaceReducer } )`. We'll also be using `undefined` for the intial state parameter since our reducers are handling initial statate on their own. And then for the last parameter of `createStore` we will be using `applyMiddleware` in combination with `promiseMiddleware`. It will look like the following code:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from "redux";
import promiseMiddleware from "redux-promise-middleware";

import listReducer from './ducks/listReducer';
import workspaceReducer from './ducks/workspaceReducer';

export default createStore( combineReducers( { listReducer, workspaceReducer } ), undefined, applyMiddleware( promiseMiddleware() ) );
```

<summary> <code> src/store.js </code> </summary>

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from "redux";
import promiseMiddleware from "redux-promise-middleware";

import listReducer from './ducks/listReducer';
import workspaceReducer from './ducks/workspaceReducer';

export default createStore( combineReducers( { listReducer, workspaceReducer } ), undefined, applyMiddleware( promiseMiddleware() ) );
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will take our store created from the previous step and hook it up in `src/index.js`. This will allow our App to compile correctly.

### Instructions

* Open `src/index.js`.
* Import `Provider` from `react-redux`.
* Import `store` from `src/store.js`.
* Wrap the `App` component in a `Provider` component:
  * The `Provider` component should have a `store` prop that equals `store`.

Now that our store is created we can hook it up to our App in `src/index.js`. This will allow our App to have access to the store and the reducers and will also allow our App to compile correctly. Let's open `src/index.js`. We'll need to import `Provider` from `react-redux` and `store` from `src/store.js`. 

```js
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from './store';
```

The `Provider` component will "provide" the store to our App. All we need to do is wrap the `App` component in a `Provider` component and give the `Proivder` component a `store` prop that equals `store`. 

```js
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from './store';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={ store }>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

</details>

### Solution

<summary> <code> src/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from './store';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={ store }>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

registerServiceWorker();
```
